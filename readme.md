# Project Garbe Vino

A collection of services for hosting the main site for Garbe Vino, a wine venture owned by Gabe Hickey.

## Development

Requires:
- Podman (or alternatively Docker)
- .NET 9 SDK or newer
- Postgresql container or hosted server

Goals:
- Develop the solution to allow cross platform deployment
- Utilise containerisation when possible
- Ensure good code coverage with unit tests, integration tests, and E2E testing
- Hosted services should require minimal resources and be resillient
- Use modern patterns and approaches at all times when possible
